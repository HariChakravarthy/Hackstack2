I have built a flutter notes app with the following features 

- **Login/Signup UI** using Firebase Auth.
- A **home screen** showing all of the userâ€™s notes.
- Ability to **add**, **edit**, and **delete** notes.
- USED and Enabled the CRUD Operations well 
- Real-time updates reflected instantly when a note is changed.
  
- User-specific data isolation: users should see **only their own notes**. I have tackled this feature with a uique id of user .


- Firebase Authentication (email/password or Google Sign-In)
- Firestore-based CRUD operations
- Timestamps for each note (created/last modified)
- USED the Indexes options in Firebase to display timestamps 
- Note ordering (e.g., most recent on top)
- Responsive UI (works on multiple screen sizes)
- Smooth UX with error handling and loading states
